I'm a PhD student in the groups of [Fernanda Duarte](https://www.duartegroupchem.org) and [Christopher Schofield](https://schofield.web.ox.ac.uk) at the University of Oxford. I apply computational chemistry techniques and machine learning to problems in drug discovery, in particular for [antimicrobial resistance](https://www.ineosoxford.ox.ac.uk).

I was previously a part of [Mohammed AlQuraishi's group at Columbia University](https://www.aqlab.io), [Frauke GrÃ¤ter's group at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies](https://www.h-its.org/research/mbm/), and a visiting scholar in [Rob Paton's group at Colorado State University](https://patonlab.com/).

I'm also a co-organiser of the [Science through Computation Initiative](https://www.compmotifs.com).
